Example 1

1. Generate a random number between a lower and upper limit and store it in a variable
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of guesses
3. Prompt the user to guess a number between the lower and upper limits
4. While the guess is incorrect:
    a. Increment the guess count by 1
    b. If the guess is too low, print a message indicating the guess was too low
    c. If the guess is too high, print a message indicating the guess was too high
    d. Prompt the user to guess again
5. If the guess is correct:
    a. Print a message indicating the user won
    b. Print the number of guesses it took the user to win
6. End the game

Example 2

import random

# initialize variables
secret_number = random.randint(1, 100)
guess = 0
attempts = 0

# game loop
while guess != secret_number:
    guess = int(input("Guess the number (between 1 and 100): "))
    attempts += 1
    if guess < secret_number:
        print("Too low, try again!")
    elif guess > secret_number:
        print("Too high, try again!")
    else:
        print(f"Congratulations, you guessed the number in {attempts} attempts!")

Example 3

1. Import the random module
2. Set a variable called "secret_number" to a random integer between 1 and 100
3. Initialize a variable called "guesses" to 0
4. Create a loop that runs while the number of guesses is less than 10:
     a. Get a guess from the user
     b. If the guess is not a valid integer between 1 and 100, tell the user and go back to step 4a
     c. Increment the number of guesses
     d. If the guess is correct, tell the user they won and end the program
     e. If the guess is incorrect, tell the user whether the guess was too high or too low and go back to step 4a
5. If the loop completes and the user has not guessed the correct number, tell the user they lost and reveal the secret number

Detailed Explanation of code

1. We first import the random module to generate random numbers.
2. We use the randint() function from the random module to generate a random integer between 1 and 100. We store this number in the number variable.
3. We initialize the num_guesses variable to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of guesses the user has made.
4. We use the print() function to display some introductory messages to the user, explaining the game and how to play.
5. We enter a while loop that will continue until the user guesses the correct number. We use True as the condition for the loop, so that it will continue indefinitely until we exit the loop using the break keyword.
6. Within the loop, we first prompt the user to enter a guess using the input() function. We store the guess in the guess variable, and we increment the num_guesses variable by 1 using the += operator.
7. We use a try block to make sure the user entered a valid number. We use the int() function to convert the user's input to an integer. If the input cannot be converted to an integer (i.e. it contains non-numeric characters), we print an error message using the print() function and continue to the next iteration of the loop.
8. We use an if statement to check if the user's guess is correct. If it is, we print a congratulatory message using the print() function, along with the number of guesses the user made. We exit the loop using the break keyword.
9. If the guess is incorrect, we use another if statement to check if the guess is too low or too high. We print a message to tell the user whether their guess was too low or too high, and we continue the loop.
