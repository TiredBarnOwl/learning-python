# Binary Decimal Converter

This is a simple program that converts between binary and decimal numbers.

## Usage

1. Run the program in your Python environment
2. Enter either a binary or decimal number when prompted
3. The program will convert the number to the opposite base and display the result

## Notes

- The program will check for valid input and display an error message if invalid input is entered
- Binary numbers should be entered as a string of 0's and 1's (e.g. "1010")
- Decimal numbers should be entered as integers (e.g. 42)
- The program uses the built-in `bin()` and `int()` functions for the conversions
