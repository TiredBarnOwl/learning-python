1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/your-username/guess-the-number.git`.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the command `cd guess-the-number`.
3. Run the program by typing `python guess_the_number.py` in the command line.

## How to Play

1. The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100.
2. You will be prompted to enter your first guess.
3. If your guess is too high or too low, the program will tell you.
