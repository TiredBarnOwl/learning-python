## Hangman

This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman game in Python. The game randomly chooses a word from a list, and the player must guess the word one letter at a time. The player has a limited number of guesses, and if they guess incorrectly too many times, they lose the game.

## Getting Started

To run the game, simply execute the Python script in your terminal or preferred Python environment. 

## How To Play

1. The game will choose a random word from the list.
2. The player will be shown the word with underscores for each missing letter.
3. The player can guess a letter by typing it in and pressing enter.
4. If the letter is in the word, the corresponding underscores will be replace      with the letter.
5. If the letter is not in the word, the player will lose a guess.
6. The game ends when either the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of guesses.
