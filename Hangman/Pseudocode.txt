Example 1

1. Choose a random word from a list of words
2. Create a list of underscores to represent each letter in the word
3. Set the maximum number of guesses allowed to 6
4. Loop until the game is over:
    a. Display the word with underscores for missing letters
    b. Prompt the user to guess a letter
    c. If the guess has already been made, inform the user and go back to step 4a
    d. If the guess is in the word, replace the corresponding underscore(s) with the guess
    e. If the guess is not in the word, reduce the number of guesses left by 1
    f. If the number of guesses left is 0, display "You lose" and reveal the word
    g. If all letters have been guessed, display "You win" and the word, and end the game


Example 2

1. Choose a random word from a list of words
2. Create a list of underscores to represent each letter in the word
3. Set the maximum number of guesses allowed to 6
4. While the number of guesses left is greater than 0 and there are still underscores in the word:
    a. Display the word with underscores for missing letters
    b. Prompt the user to guess a letter
    c. If the guess has already been made, inform the user and go back to step 4a
    d. If the guess is in the word, replace the corresponding underscore(s) with the guess
    e. If the guess is not in the word, reduce the number of guesses left by 1
5. If the number of guesses left is 0, display "You lose" and reveal the word
6. If all letters have been guessed, display "You win" and the word

Detailed Expanation of code

The code starts with an import statement to import the random module.
A list of words is created to choose from. This list can be edited to add or remove words.
A random word is chosen from the list using the random.choice() function.
A list of underscores is created with the same length as the chosen word, representing each letter in the word that needs to be guessed.
A set is created to store the letters that the user has guessed so far.
The maximum number of guesses allowed is set to 6, but this can be changed.
The main game loop starts and runs until the game is over.
Inside the loop, the current state of the word to be guessed is displayed to the user with underscores for missing letters.
The user is prompted to guess a letter.
If the letter has already been guessed, the user is informed and prompted again.
If the letter has not been guessed before, it is added to the set of guessed letters.
If the guessed letter is in the word, the user is informed and the underscores in the display list are replaced with the correct letter at the appropriate positions.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, the user is informed and the number of guesses left is reduced by 1.
The game checks if the maximum number of guesses has been reached, in which case the user loses and the word is revealed.
If all letters have been guessed correctly, the user wins and the game ends.
